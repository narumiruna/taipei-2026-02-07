## Key Findings & Insights

### Critical Discovery
**Group capacity verification essential**: 二本松涮涮屋 (Erben Song), despite being highly rated ("PRADA of hot pot"), was excluded because its private room only accommodates 8-10 people, insufficient for 16-20 person groups.

**Lesson**: Always verify exact capacity early in research for large group requirements.

### Best Value Recommendation
**Haidilao (海底撈) Qzhan Branch** offers the best value:
- Capacity: 20 people (rooms can combine)
- Price: Mid-range (NT$500-800/person vs NT$1000-2000+ at other top options)
- Service: Exceptional (signature feature)
- Convenience: Best location (Taipei Main Station)
- Score: 41/50 (2nd highest)

### Premium Options
For high-end events:
- **Business**: A CUT (Michelin star, NT$35k-60k minimum)
- **Celebration**: Orange Shabu (luxury hot pot, NT$1000+/person)
- **Traditional**: Bando Club (Taiwanese banquet, NT$25k-70k minimum)

### Reservation Strategy
**All top recommendations require advance booking**:
- 2-4 weeks ahead: A CUT, Orange Shabu, Bando Club
- 1-2 weeks ahead: Haidilao

**Critical**: Must specify "16-20 person group + private room" when booking.

## Process Improvements Applied

1. **AGENTS.md Enhancement**: Added `group capacity` field to practical information template
2. **Efficient Research**: Used comprehensive web searches to gather multiple candidates quickly
3. **Prioritization**: Focused on top 4 high-scoring candidates rather than researching all 15 exhaustively
4. **Preservation vs Deletion**: Documented lower-priority candidates in excluded.md rather than deleting them

---

## Recommended Next Actions

### For Immediate Use
1. Review top-places.md for final recommendations
2. Decide on preferred restaurant based on:
   - Budget (Haidilao = best value, A CUT = most premium)
   - Occasion (business vs family vs celebration)
   - Location preference
3. Make reservation 2-4 weeks before dining date
4. Confirm exact headcount (16-20) when booking

### For Future Enhancement (Optional)
1. Research青花驕麻辣鍋 (Chin Hua Jiao) - Wang Pin Group, verified 20-person capacity
2. Research YEN Chinese Restaurant - W Hotel, has 5 private rooms
3. Update if group size changes below 10 people (二本松 becomes viable)
