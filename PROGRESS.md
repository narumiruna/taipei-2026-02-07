## Key Findings & Insights

### Critical Discovery
**Celebrity endorsements matter**: 春韭 (Chunjiu) received massive demand surge after Jensen Huang's visit and $800 tip story went viral. NVIDIA CEO's personal recommendation validates quality and creates booking challenges (need 6-8 weeks advance).

**Group capacity verification essential**: 二本松涮涮屋 (Erben Song), despite being highly rated ("PRADA of hot pot"), was excluded because its private room only accommodates 8-10 people, insufficient for 16-20 person groups.

**Cash-only restaurants exist**: 春韭 only accepts cash (no credit cards), requiring advance planning for large groups (~NT$80,000 for 20 people).

### Best Value Recommendations
**饗饗 INPARADISE** offers best convenience and value:
- Capacity: 20+ people (rooms available, mostly open seating)
- Price: Mid-high (NT$1,790-2,090/person + 10% vs NT$1,500-4,000+ at other top options)
- View: Spectacular 46F Taipei 101 skyline
- Convenience: Best MRT access (Taipei City Hall Station direct)
- Score: 39/50 (tied for 3rd highest)

### Premium Options Ranking
For high-end events by occasion:
1. **Business/Corporate**: A CUT (Michelin 1-star, NT$35k-60k room minimum) or 海峽會 (VIP club, NT$2k-10k/person)
2. **Celebration/Special Occasion**: 春韭 (Jensen Huang's favorite, unique experience) or 南村私廚 (Michelin Plate 3+ years)
3. **Luxury Hot Pot**: 橘色涮涮屋 (Michelin Plate, "LV of hot pot")
4. **Scenic Buffet**: 饗饗 (46F views, 4-hour dining)

### Reservation Strategy
**All top recommendations require advance booking**:
- **6-8 weeks ahead**: 春韭 (post-Jensen Huang booking surge)
- **2-4 weeks ahead**: A CUT, 橘色, 海峽會, 南村私廚
- **1-2 months ahead**: 饗饗 (especially weekends), Zaap

**Critical**: Must specify "16-20 person group + private room" when booking.

**Payment considerations**:
- Most accept credit cards
- **春韭: CASH ONLY** (withdraw ~NT$80,000 for 20 people)
- 海峽會: Strict deposit policy (no refund if cancel day before)

## Recommended Next Actions

### For Immediate Use
1. Review top-places.md for final 5 Top Picks + 2 Backups
2. Decide on preferred restaurant(s) based on:
   - **Budget**: 饗饗 = best value (NT$1,790-2,090/person), 春韭/A CUT = most premium
   - **Occasion**: Business (A CUT/海峽會), Celebration (春韭/南村私廚), Scenic (饗饗)
   - **Cuisine preference**: Taiwanese (春韭/南村私廚), International (A CUT/橘色/Zaap/饗饗)
3. Make reservations 2-8 weeks before dining date (春韭 needs longest lead time)
4. Confirm exact headcount (16-20) and specify private room requirements
5. For 春韭: Withdraw cash in advance (~NT$80,000 for 20 people)

### Optional Future Enhancement
1. Research additional Michelin options (老烤箱, baan Taipei) if needed
2. Research additional buffet options (凱菲屋, 栢麗廳) if scenic dining preferred
3. Update if group size changes (二本松 becomes viable if ≤10 people)
